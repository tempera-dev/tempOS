# beaterOS Runtime And Evidence Schemas

JSON Schemas (draft 2020-12) for runtime, evidence, optimization, and eval
artifacts that sit around the tempOS core contracts.

This directory is **not** the canonical source of truth for the core wire
contracts. The canonical, language-neutral core contract source is
[`spec/contracts`](../spec/contracts), documented in
[`spec/README.md`](../spec/README.md), and validated by
[`spec/conformance/validate.py`](../spec/conformance/validate.py). When a schema
name exists in both directories, `spec/contracts` owns the portable core
contract shape.

`contracts/schema` may carry broader runtime/evidence schemas and compatibility
mirrors needed by local tooling. Those mirrors must either be regenerated from
the core source or explicitly documented as runtime-specific extensions before
they diverge.

| `performance-trace.schema.json` | Optimization trace evidence envelope | §8, §13 |
| `accelerator-telemetry.schema.json` | Vendor-neutral accelerator job telemetry | §8, §13 |
| `worker-preflight-plan.schema.json` | Side-effect-free worker scheduler plan | §4.4, §6.4, §7 |
| `mcp-local-shell-call.schema.json` | Argument payload for the `tempos.local_shell` MCP stdio tool | §8.6, §13.6, §24 |
| `mcp-local-shell-result.schema.json` | Structured result payload for the `tempos.local_shell` MCP stdio tool | §8.6, §13.6, §24 |

## Versioning & provenance

- Runtime mirrors should track the `crates/beater-os-core` wire format: exact
  field names and snake_case enum values that match serde's
  `rename_all = "snake_case"`. Core contract changes start in `spec/contracts`.
- `additionalProperties: false` throughout, so the corpus is validated strictly.
  When the Rust core adds a field, add it here in the same or a follow-up change
  and note it in `AGENTS.md` (PR #19/#20 own that coordination doc).
- Enum orderings that carry meaning (`risk_class`, `data_class`) are listed in
  severity order; the conformance harness relies on that order for ceiling
  comparisons.

## Validation

The schemas are exercised by the conformance gate:

```
python3 tools/conformance/validate.py
```

See `tools/conformance/README.md` for the semantic invariants (admission,
causality, hash chains) layered on top of structural validation, and for the
open cross-language canonical-hashing item.

Run the canonicality wording guard after editing this README:

```
python3 scripts/check-contract-canonicality.py
```
