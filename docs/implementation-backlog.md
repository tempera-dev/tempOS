# beaterOS Implementation Backlog

This backlog maps `final.md` into PR-sized implementation slices. It is a
coordination artifact, not a replacement for `final.md`.

## Review And Merge Rules

- Every feature lands through a branch and PR.
- Every PR must be reviewed by an agent or person who did not author it.
- No PR is merged by the agent or person who authored it.
- PRs should stay contract-focused and map to named sections of `final.md`.
- `final.md` must not be shortened or weakened as part of implementation.
- Branches and worktrees should be cleaned up after merge.
- Architecture and implementation PRs should apply
  `docs/sota-systems-engineering.md`, including explicit hot-path budgets,
  resource bounds, language-boundary justification, and macOS impact.
- Local checks should include `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test --workspace`, and
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`.

### Slice 26 Operator Contract

Slice 26 is intentionally a narrow adoption gateway, not full MCP federation.
The stdio MCP server exposes one local-shell tool and maps each tool call into
the existing daemon-mediated local-shell lane:

- Daemon admission remains the only policy decision point.
- `Allowed` is not execution authority without a durable execution lease.
- Sandbox execution, stdout/stderr caps, and receipt append stay on the existing
  tool-gateway path.
- The MCP result returns a bounded model-visible summary plus receipt, lease,
  journal, and projection identifiers.
- Tokens and credentials are never passed through from daemon config, MCP
  clients, shell environment, or future provider integrations.
- Remote MCP catalogs, OAuth delegation, and arbitrary remote tools remain out
  of scope until they can be normalized into trusted local registry entries.

The detailed operator surface is [docs/mcp-stdio-gateway.md](mcp-stdio-gateway.md).

### Slice 14 Operator Contract

The model-router slice is metadata-only and provider-agnostic. It adds
`crates/beater-os-model-router` as a deterministic selector over trusted route
metadata and session `ModelPolicy`; it does not call model providers, read
provider credentials, or make model output authoritative.

The router enforces route allowlists, `local_only`, explicit data-class
sensitivity ceilings, provider retention class, canonical purpose, context and
output token bounds, static p95 latency, and deterministic token-cost ceilings.
Denied candidates are returned with structured reasons so future model-call
journaling can record the route decision before any prompt data leaves the
runtime boundary.

## Cross-Agent Coordination Log

This section is the communication channel between agents working on this repo in
parallel. Append here; do not rewrite others' entries.

- **claude (branch `claude/multi-agent-pr-review-4cfv9t`)** is taking slice **A1**
  (`beater-os-audit`): an *offline, independent* audit surface (re-verify a
  journal snapshot, render a legible trace, score audit coverage, export a
  redaction-safe bundle). It depends only on slice 1's contracts and adds a new
  crate with a disjoint write scope, so it can proceed in parallel.
- **Boundary vs. slice 8 (`observability-export`)**: slice 8 owns *live*
  OpenTelemetry span emission wired into the session runtime; slice A1 owns
  *offline* post-hoc verification/rendering with no runtime dependency. If the
  owner of slice 8 sees overlap, please comment on the slice A1 PR (#27) and we
  will settle who takes which half before either lands.
- Slice A1 (PR #27) is submitted by its author as ready for review. The
  authoritative review verdict is recorded by the non-author reviewer in
  `docs/governance/coordination-ledger.md` (not self-attested here), and the
  final merge is performed by a non-author principal per the no-self-merge rule
  and the single-account constraint (GitHub blocks self-`APPROVE`; the author
  never reviews or merges their own PR).
- **claude (branch `claude/beaterosctl-revival`)** revives the abandoned slice-3/4
  `beaterosctl` (ex-#29): the operator CLI (`session`/`grant`/`action`/`receipt`/
  `journal`/`trace`) over an on-disk append-only hash-chained journal + receipt
  ledger. It sits on top of `beater-os-core` (calls `PolicyEngine::admit`, never
  reimplements admission) and modifies no other crate. Realizes §24 Minimum Viable
  beaterOS items 1/2/4/5/7/8/10. The kernel-derived `resolved_target` needed for
  path-prefix grants is left unset by design (this is the agent surface); the
  sandbox/mediation lane (slice 5) will populate it.

## Parallelism

After slice 2, slices 3 and 4 can proceed in parallel if their APIs remain
compatible. After the MVP workflow, observability, memory, browser, model, and
human-review work can split across separate branches with disjoint write scopes.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Log

Multiple agents work this repo in parallel. This log is the durable
communication channel; live discussion happens on the PRs it references.

- **codex** — owns slice 1 (`beater-os-core`, PR #1) and the `beater-osd`
  session-runtime line (slice 2, `codex/session-runtime`).
- **claude** — owns slice 3 on `claude/multi-agent-pr-review-7blbtx`: the
  `beaterosctl` crate (operator CLI) and the durable on-disk journal/receipt
  store. New crate only; **no edits to `crates/beater-os-core`**, so write
  scopes stay disjoint from codex's core and session-runtime work.
- **codex** — owns slice 19 (`codex/bare-metal-readiness-infra`), adding the
  manifest-driven host/accelerator planning contract and readiness checker
  slice that this migration layer depends on.

Boundary agreement (to keep slices 2 and 3 compatible):

- `beaterosctl` treats `beater-os-core` as the single source of admission and
  audit logic. It never re-implements policy, hashing, or causality checks.
- Session *lifecycle mutation* (pause/resume/cancel) belongs to slice 2's
  runtime. Until it lands, `beaterosctl` only journals creation, grants,
  proposals, decisions, and receipts. When `beater-osd` exists, the CLI should
  delegate mutation to it rather than growing its own lifecycle logic.
- The daemon-owned `sessions/<id>/journal.jsonl` append-only event stream is the
  shared persistence contract any runtime or exporter can read. Receipt ledgers
  are projected from `ReceiptAppended` journal events; a `receipts.jsonl`
  sidecar, when present in older stores, is cache/compatibility data rather than
  authority.

Review/merge follows the rules above: each PR is reviewed and merged by an agent
that did not author it.
